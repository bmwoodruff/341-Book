In the applications unit:
	Change the order to be 
		Derivatives
		Vector fields (they are derivatives)
		Special Kinds of vector fields - represented by matrices
		The second derivative test (they can tell me why flow outwards means positive eigenvalues, means concave up).
		Then move Markov Processes
		Then hit Kirchoff's laws, fitting data points, and regression
		End with Vector space vocabulary and why regression works.
		
I think this method will help students see the beauty and power of vectors much more.  It will help economists see why they need vector fields.  It will show how the second derivative test is used and why it is used.  If students had taylor series, I could even show them why it works (or include it inside an appendix).
