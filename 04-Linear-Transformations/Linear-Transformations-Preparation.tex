\section{Preparation}

\noindent
This chapter covers the following ideas. When you create your lesson plan, it should contain examples which illustrate these key ideas. Before you take the quiz on this unit, meet with another student out of class and teach each other from the examples on your lesson plan.

Here are the preparation problems for this unit.  Problems that come from Schaum's Outlines ``Beginning Linear Algebra'' are preceded by a chapter number. From here on out, many of the problems we will be working on come from Schaum's Outlines.  Realize that sometimes the method of solving the problem in Schaum's Outlines will differ from how we solve the problem in class. The difference is that in Schaum's Outlines they almost always place vectors in rows prior to row reduction, whereas we will be placing vectors in columns. There are pros and cons to both methods. Using columns helps us focus on understanding coordinates of vectors relative to bases, whereas using rows helps us determine when two vector spaces are the same.
